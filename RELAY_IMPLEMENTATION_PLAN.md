# Quasar Relay System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to implement a TeamViewer-like relay system for Quasar using Docker, eliminating the need for port forwarding and making remote connections user-friendly.

## Phase 1: Architecture and Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)

### Relay Server Components
- [ ] **STUN Server**: To help clients discover their public IP/port
- [ ] **TURN Server**: To relay traffic when direct connection isn't possible
- [ ] **Signaling Server**: To coordinate connection establishment
- [ ] **Authentication Service**: To manage device IDs and authentication

### Docker Setup
- [x] Create a `docker-compose.yml` with services for:
  - [x] STUN/TURN server (using coturn)
  - [x] Signaling server (Node.js/WebSockets)
  - [x] Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
  - [x] Reverse proxy (NGINX)

### Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] Public-facing VM/server with stable IP address
- [ ] Domain name for the relay service
- [ ] SSL certificates for secure communication

## Phase 2: Protocol and Core Components (3-4 weeks)

### Protocol Design
- [ ] Define the connection establishment protocol
- [ ] Design device registration and authentication flow
- [ ] Develop secure ID generation system (9-digit IDs like TeamViewer)
- [ ] Create protocol for session initiation and relay fallback

### New Core Components
- [x] `Quasar.Common.Relay`: Shared relay protocol library
  - [x] Connection handshake
  - [x] Authentication
  - [x] Session management
   
- [ ] `Quasar.Relay.Server`: Relay server implementation
  - [ ] Device registration
  - [ ] Connection brokering
  - [ ] Traffic relaying when needed

## Phase 3: Client Integration (2-3 weeks)

### Client Changes
- [x] Modify `Client.cs` to support both direct and relay connections
- [x] Add device registration during client startup
- [x] Implement connection logic for relay-based connections
- [x] Create fallback mechanism (prioritize relay, then direct as fallback)

### UI Updates
- [x] New client builder settings for relay connection
- [x] ID/password display in server UI
- [x] Connection management interface

## Phase 4: Security and Testing (2 weeks)

### Security Measures
- [x] End-to-end encryption for relay connections (Completed)
- [x] Rate limiting to prevent abuse (Completed)
- [x] Secure storage of credentials (Completed)
- [x] Connection auditing and logging (Completed)

### Testing Plan
- [x] Local testing with simulated NAT environments (Completed)
- [ ] Beta deployment with limited users
- [ ] Load testing the relay infrastructure
- [ ] Security assessment

## Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation (1-2 weeks)

### Deployment
- [x] Create production Docker deployment scripts (Completed)
- [x] Setup monitoring and alerts (Completed)
- [x] Implement backup strategy for relay server data (Completed)

### Documentation
- [x] User guide for relay connection (Completed)
- [x] Server setup documentation for self-hosting (Completed)
- [ ] Update developer documentation with new architecture

## Resources Needed

### Development
- [ ] .NET developer with networking experience
- [ ] DevOps engineer for Docker/infrastructure setup
- [ ] UI developer for client interface changes

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Cloud server (AWS/Azure/Digital Ocean)
- [ ] Docker registry for images
- [ ] Domain name and SSL certificates

## Timeline and Milestones
- **Total estimated time**: 10-14 weeks
- **Key milestones**:
  - [x] Proof of concept relay connection (week 4)
  - [x] First end-to-end relay connection (week 7)
  - [ ] Beta testing with real-world clients (week 10)
  - [ ] Production release (week 12-14)

## Implementation Status
- Phase 1: In progress (Docker setup complete)
- Phase 2: In progress (Relay protocol library complete)  
- Phase 3: Complete (Client integration, UI updates, connection logic)
- Phase 4: In progress (Security measures complete, testing in progress)
- Phase 5: Not started

This implementation will transform Quasar into a much more user-friendly remote administration tool with TeamViewer-like connection capabilities, eliminating the need for port forwarding and making it accessible to non-technical users.
